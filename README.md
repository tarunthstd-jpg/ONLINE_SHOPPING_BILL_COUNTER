# ONLINE_SHOPPING_BILL_COUNTER
The Online Shopping Bill Counter project is a simple Python-based application that simulates the billing process of an online shopping system. The program allows the user to enter the prices of multiple items one by one, similar to adding items to a shopping cart. Using a while loop, the program continuously accepts item prices and adds them to a running total.

The input process continues until the user enters 0, which acts as a termination condition indicating that no more items are left to be added. Once the loop ends, the program calculates and displays the final total bill amount.This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as loops, conditional statements, user input, and variable handling. It is a beginner-friendly project that helps learners understand how programming can be applied to real-world scenarios like online shopping and billing systems.
